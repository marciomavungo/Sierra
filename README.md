## Overview
ViewLock is a tool designed to **enforce view-once security for images**.  
It prevents unauthorized captures by external cameras and ensures sensitive images remain protected.

This project is currently a **prototype**, built for demonstration and testing purposes.  
The final version is intended for commercial use and integration with secure image viewers or mobile camera apps.

---

## Features
- Detects protected images in real time
- Blocks saving or capturing of view-once images
- Private, secure environment for sensitive content
- Modular design for future integration with mobile apps

---

## Demo
*(Optional: insert GIF, screenshot, or video of watermark detection and view-once enforcement)*

## Installation
Currently, ViewLock is in prototype form and can be tested on your development machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ViewLock.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd ViewLock

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the prototype
python main.py
```

---

## Usage
1. Open the application (Python prototype or iOS app).  
2. Point the camera at a watermarked image.  
3. The software will detect protected content in real time.  
4. If the image is protected, saving or capturing will be blocked automatically.
